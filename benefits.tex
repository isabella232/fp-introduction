why would we do this? what are the practical benefits?

\begin{block}{why?}
\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> the practical benefits are not always immediately obvious
\item<2-> this is especially true when given trivial examples, such as summing a list
\item<3-> but is there a point to all this?
\item<4-> a benefit to throwing away familiar tools, and replacing them?
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{some general ``handwavy'' benefits are}
\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> an ability to \emph{reason} about \emph{discrete} programs (which may be sub-programs)
\item<2-> an ability to \emph{compose} sub-programs to make slightly less small programs, \emph{indefinitely}
