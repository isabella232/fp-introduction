# Introduction to Functional Programming

Tony will take you through the definition of Functional Programming (FP), then discuss some of the general and practical consequences of achieving the FP thesis. The introduction to FP definitions is built on existing knowledge of programming and mainstream programming languages.

After the introductory, Tony will hand over to Dave who will go into some of the finer details of Functional Programming.
