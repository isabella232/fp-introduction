# Introduction to Functional Programming

Tony will take you through the definition of Functional Programming (FP), then discuss some of the general and practical consequences of achieving the FP thesis. The introduction to FP definitions is built on existing knowledge of programming and mainstream programming languages. We will ask questions around why FP is worth considering for any software project, discuss the benefits and the potential pitfalls.

Some of the more difficult questions around FP will be put forward for further discussion. A student of FP can often be overwhelmed by the available material and constructing a purposeful learning path, so we will discuss this as well.
